    Job Description

    Our team, Spyglass, is part of the Core Services engineering organization. Our mission is to build and scale data compliance systems at Zendesk. We chose the name Spyglass because it evokes the idea of always looking ahead: we are charting the course for how these systems will evolve. Plus, we thought it would make a cool logo.

    Our current project is to develop an orchestration framework that can handle different types of data management requests. Some examples include: honoring a user's "right to be forgotten," or moving our customers' data to a different geographical region to reduce latency. These operations require the participation of many teams and services. Effective technical communication—via documentation or pairing or meetings—is crucial to our success.

    We are a small team trying to answer big questions: What is the right distributed transaction pattern for our use cases? How do we safely move terabytes of data across the world, without downtime and without putting too much load on the entire system? If you're intrigued and motivated by this problem space, we encourage you to apply.
    Our responsibility to you
    We will welcome and consider your recommendations for how to improve our code, architecture, documentation, and team processes
    We make decisions openly
    We foster a culture of belonging and inclusion
    We will ensure there is a meaningful link to your contributions and the objectives of the company
    We will help build your people-network internally
    Your responsibilities at Zendesk
    Build an orchestration framework used to coordinate long-lived operations across a collection of services
    Ship reliable code and document it well
    Contribute to our product and technical roadmaps
    Communicate effectively and with empathy
    Own the team’s services - you believe in taking ownership of infrastructure, design, development, testing, deployment, and are capable of debugging operational issues
    You should have some of these skills:
    Proficiency with at least one of the following languages: Ruby, Scala, Go, Java.
    Ability to work through unfamiliar code and technologies.
    A deep understanding of relational and non-relational storages and their trade-offs.
    Experience with some of the more relevant technologies at Zendesk: MySQL, Aurora and DynamoDB.
    Experience with event-driven, distributed architecture using Kafka, SNS/SQS.
    Familiarity with at least one modern web frameworks (e.g. Rails, Finatra, Akka-Http).
    Familiarity with AWS CLI and SDKs
    Familiarity with or interest in “infrastructure as code” toolings such as Chef, Terraform, or CloudFormation

    Zendesk builds software for better customer relationships. It empowers organizations to improve customer engagement and better understand their customers. Zendesk products are easy to use and implement. They give organizations the flexibility to move quickly, focus on innovation, and scale with their growth.

    More than 100,000 paid customer accounts in over 150 countries and territories use Zendesk products. Based in San Francisco, Zendesk has operations in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.
